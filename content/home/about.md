# Welcome!

I am a 4th year Graduate Student in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, working in the lab of Vincent J Lynch. My thesis focuses on the role that duplicated tumor supressors play in resolving Peto's Paradox in clades containing large, long-lived species such as: Paenungulata (featuring the African Elephant); Chiroptera (with a variety of long-lived and large bats); and Balaenidae (home to the famous Bowhead Whale).
