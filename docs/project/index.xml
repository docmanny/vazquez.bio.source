      <description>One of the many observations we have made is frequently referred to as Peto&amp;rsquo;s Paradox, so named after Richard Peto, who showed in 1975 that, per cell, mice had a higher rate of cancer than humans, and mused about the relationship between body-size and cancer rates. The Paradox, in a nutshell, comes from the simple fact that every cell in an animal&amp;rsquo;s body has the potential to become a tumor given the right set of mutations; furthermore, cells will steadily accumulate mutations throughout their lifetime.</description>
